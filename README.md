## Architecture

Like most of cloud apps. This app will need a:

-   **Database** for storing users data and messages.
-   Backend services for handling API calls, **authentication**, **session management**, **authorization** and **file management**.

In a classical way, **Laravel** with **MySQL** can handle all the above. But now the special part is enabling realtime messaging, if you are a lazy engineer and do not care about your client/employer bills its ok to pick **Firebase** to handle the messaging part. But if you have enough experience you already know that realtime data needs to be mobilized using realtime protocols such as `websocket`, and you are asking your self which websocket server implementation to couple with the chosen backend.

**Laravel** comes bundled with tools that support, **events**, **notifications**, **broadcasting**, and **queues**. But doesn't support any realtime protocol out of the box but instead of letting us stray alone looking for websocket servers to couple with **Laravel**. It eases and recommends the integration of [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) or [Ably](https://ably.com/). Even better, the community maintains packages that can be used as alternative, compatible, self hosted APIs for **Pusher**.

1. [Laravel Websockets](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/getting-started/introduction) is a PHP package built on top of [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/), [read more...](https://freek.dev/1228-introducing-laravel-websockets-an-easy-to-use-websocket-server-implemented-in-php).
2. [Soketi](https://soketi.app/) is a NodeJS package built on top of ÂµWebSockets.js.

My preference is `laravel-websockets` for the simple fact of being able to maintain it in one repository with the **Laravel** backend.

For the client side `pusher-js` library is the go to, and `laravel-echo` makes it even easier to use publish and subscribe from the browsers.

To be more exhaustive, this demo will be using `sanctum` for authenticating API calls. And `axios` as a front end HTTP client.

### Scaling

<https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/faq/scaling>

## Database

Supporting group events has a huge impact on the database design!

## Scaffolding

```shell
laravel new --git messenger-clone
```

```shell
composer require laravel/sanctum
```

```shell
composer require pusher/pusher-php-server:7.0.2
```

> Version compatibilty issue <https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-websockets/issues/1041>

```shell
composer require beyondcode/laravel-websockets
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BeyondCode\LaravelWebSockets\WebSocketsServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

```shell
npm install --save-dev laravel-echo pusher-js
```

Setup a database and the `env` configs.

## Config

The following config makes it easy to switch between **Pusher** and **Laravel Websockets**.

```env
# .env
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher

PUSHER_APP_ID=
PUSHER_APP_KEY=
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=
PUSHER_HOST=#api-CLUSTER.pusher.com or 127.0.0.1
PUSHER_PORT=443# or any other port (recommend 6001 for Laravel Websockets)
PUSHER_SCHEME=https# or http
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=

LARAVEL_WEBSOCKETS_ENABLE_CLIENT_MESSAGES=true

VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
VITE_PUSHER_HOST="${PUSHER_HOST}"
VITE_PUSHER_PORT="${PUSHER_PORT}"
VITE_PUSHER_SCHEME="${PUSHER_SCHEME}"
VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
```

Add Sanctum's middleware `\Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class` to api middleware group within `app/Http/Kernel.php`.

Register `App\Providers\BroadcastServiceProvider::class` in `config/app.php`.

```php

            ],
        ],
        // ...
    ]
    // ...
];
```

```php
// config\websockets.php
return [
    'dashboard' => [
        'port' => env('PUSHER_PORT', 6001),

## Laravel broadcasting

### Channels

-   Events are broadcast over "channels", which may be specified as **public** or **private**.
-   Any visitor may subscribe to a **public channel** without any **authentication** or **authorization**.
-   In order to subscribe to a **private channel**, a user must be **authenticated** and **authorized** to listen on that channel.

Instances of `Channel` represent **public channels** that any user may subscribe to, while `PrivateChannels` and `PresenceChannels` represent **private channels** that require **authorization**.

### Events

#### ShouldBroadcast

Broadcastable events must implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast` interface, This will instruct Laravel to broadcast the event when it is fired.

#### broadcastOn

The `ShouldBroadcast` interface requires the event to define a `broadcastOn` method. The method returns the channel to broadcast the event on.

-   `Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel`,
-   `Illuminate\Broadcasting\PrivateChannel`
-   `Illuminate\Broadcasting\PresenceChannel`

#### broadcastAs

By default, Laravel will broadcast the event using the event's class name. However, you may customize the broadcast name.

```php
/**
 * The event's broadcast name.
 */
public function broadcastAs()
{
    return 'EventName';
}
```

#### broadcastWith

When an event is broadcast, all of its `public` properties are automatically serialized and broadcast as the event's payload.

```php
/**
 * Get the data to broadcast.
 */
public function broadcastWith()
{
    return $data;
}
```

#### broadcastWhen

Sometimes you want to broadcast your event only if a given condition is true.

```php
/**
 * Determine if this event should broadcast.
 */
public function broadcastWhen()
{
    return true;
}
```

#### broadcastQueue

Once the event has been fired, a queued job will automatically broadcast the event using your specified broadcast driver.

By default, each broadcast event is placed on the default queue for the default queue connection specified in `config\queue.php` file.

### Authorization

Authorizing that the currently authenticated user can actually listen on the **private channel** is accomplished by, making an HTTP request to your Laravel application with the channel name, and allowing your application to determine if the user can listen on that channel.

When using `Echo`, the HTTP request to **authorize subscriptions** to **private channels** will be made automatically; however, you do need to define the proper routes to respond to these requests.

In `app\Providers\BroadcastServiceProvider.php`, the `Broadcast::routes` method registers the `/broadcasting/auth` route to handle authorization requests. The method will automatically place its routes within the `web` **middleware group**; however, you may pass an array of route attributes to the method if you would like to customize the assigned attributes.

Channel authorization rules are defined in `routes/channels.php`.

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Broadcast;

Broadcast::channel('name.{param}', function (User $user, bool|int|string|float $param): bool {
    // true = authorized
    return auth()->check();
});
```

### Echo

```js
Echo.private(`name.${param}`).listen("SomeEvent", (e) => {
    console.log(e);
});
```

#### Custom authorization endpoint

By default, `Echo` will use the `/broadcasting/auth` endpoint to authorize channel access. However, you may customize it.

```js
window.Echo = new Echo({
    broadcaster: "pusher",
    // ...
    authEndpoint: "/custom/endpoint/auth",
});
```

#### Customizing the authorization request
